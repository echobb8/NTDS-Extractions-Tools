# NTDS Extractions Tools

An older version (2014-04-06) of libesedb is used as newer versions are slow to extract large NTDS.dit files.

## To use

* Clone this repo
* Make 'setup.sh' executable and run it
* Copy 'NTDS.dit', 'SYSTEM' and 'SAM' into the NTDS directory
* Execute 'extract.sh'

## Credits
All credit for the tools go to the creator of libesedb (https://github.com/libyal/libesedb), scripts and automation created by Rob Emmerson.
